# ANN_tutorial
This is a short intro tutorial about how NN's work. The first part will look at usin Artificial Neural Networks for classification problerms. We start with the simplest linear classification problem, and show it can be solved by a single perceptron (no hidden layer)./n
Then for more complex classification data, a hidden layer is needed./n
/n
When we turn to regression, we will see that NN's can only do regression within the range of the training data. This means simple NN's cannot predict on input outside of the training range. To solve this, we turn to LSTM's and finally Transformers.

# Structure
At the current point there are two Notebooks. One complete which stands completely on its own. With the right libraries installed it runs as is. Then, there is one where the data generating functions and util functions have been outsourced to the custom mylib library. The latter notebook will be cast into python script form.

# Under construction

1. python3 -m venv ~/.ANN_tutorial
2. source ~./ANN_tutorial/bin/activate
